Dog Breed Classifier Using MobileNetV2
# Dog Breed Classifier Using MobileNetV2

This project is a Summer Internship. It is an AI-based application that classifies dog breeds from uploaded images using a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model.

## Project Overview

With the increasing number of dog breeds and the difficulty for many pet owners and enthusiasts to identify the breed of their pets, this project aims to provide a quick and easy solution to recognize dog breeds from images. The classifier helps in pet identification, veterinary assistance, and animal welfare.

## Features

- Upload a dog image and get the predicted breed with confidence score
- Uses TensorFlow and MobileNetV2 pre-trained on ImageNet for accurate classification
- Simple, easy-to-use interface (implemented as a Jupyter Notebook)
- Open source code for reproducibility and further development

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow & Keras
- MobileNetV2 pre-trained model
- Google Colab (recommended for running the notebook)
- GitHub for version control and project hosting

## How to Use

1. Open the `dog_breed_classifier.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab or your local Jupyter environment.
2. Upload an image of a dog.
3. Run the cells to preprocess the image and make predictions.
4. View the predicted breed along with the confidence score.
